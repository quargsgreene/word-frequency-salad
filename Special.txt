Special
You’re so special Special
You’re special
I say you’re so special
They say you’re too special
You’re just so damn special
too special
Without you, my life’s too disheveled
They claim we’re totally mismatched But I’m so attached
They’ll never say that you’re a catch But I’ve made my pledge
When you’re around my piercing voice is truly apt to
Gush about you while my ramblings drown in a mess of shameful noise about you

About you they never want to hear
They’ve to make you disappear
So very frequently I’ve feared,
One day you simply won’t be here
Yeah, I can’t help it, they can smell it,
Upon you I’m dwelling, I can’t stop telling, all about you I’m yelling
People often notice that with you I’m just so obsessive
Sometimes they’ll even find my dedication quite impressive
You make the world make sense, it’s so intense, you’re my defense, my purpose hence
You’re predictable, unconditional, it’s a miracle
Miracle
I say you’re so special
Special
They say you’re too special Special
You’re just so damn special
Without you, my life’s too disheveled Special
That’s right,
I’ve dug up so many silly random things about you
They said I could fill a reference book with all of it too Yay!
I brought some of your stuff with me to school And it didn’t look cool
But I’ve worn your shit in public
Some people loved it, so I say fuck it
You might be thinking at the moment that I’m a raging stalker

 There’s no need to worry, I’m not too much more than an innocent talker
Some say, I could do you for a living, no misgivings
Sometimes, I’m so grateful for you, that it’s almost like Thanksgiving
People often notice that with you I’m just so obsessive
Sometimes they’ll even find my dedication a bit oppressive
You make the world make sense, it’s so intense, you’re my defense, my purpose hence
You’re predictable, unconditional, it’s a fucking miracle Woah!
I say you’re so special Special
They say you’re too special
Too special
You’re just so motherfucking special
Without you, my life’s too disheveled Special
Special
Special
You’re so special Special
Special
You’re too special Special
You’re so special Special Special
Special
You’re too special Special
